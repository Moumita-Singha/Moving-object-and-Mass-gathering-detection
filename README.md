# Moving-object-and-Mass-gathering-detection
In this project, I am trying to detect any moving object in a video. The main motive here is to do motion detection in videos with bounding box. This project is also useful when I am trying to identify if there any mass gathering occurred or not. We have developed our project in such a way that it will detect social distance violation and generate alert to notify about our phenomena. If the number of bounding boxes are more than one range then “Alert” message will show on our window screen.
